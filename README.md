# Processing steps

## Genodata
It was first processed in bash with scripts/process_geno_data.sh and then minimally formatted to a usable csv with numeric genotype calls.

## Others
checked with scripts/preprocessing.ipynb. 

# Usage 
Since the object sizes are becoming large. I would propose to run the script on your local system to save the curated file locally.
